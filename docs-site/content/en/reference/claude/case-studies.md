### Individual Projects

#### iOS App (App Store Release)

**Background**: Non-engineer

**What Was Built**: Native iOS app

**Development Time**: 5 days

**Model Used**: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)

**Key Insight**: A non-engineer successfully released a native app to the App Store. Discusses what "delegating everything to AI" actually means in practice.

#### TODO App

**Development Time**: 5 minutes (30 minutes including deployment)

**Features**: Add/delete tasks, toggle completion, filtering, local storage

**Key Insight**: Single prompt to completion, deployed to GitHub Pages and Vercel

## Patterns from Case Studies

### What Claude Code Excels At

1. **New Project Setup** - Environment configuration, boilerplate generation
2. **Prototype Development** - Quickly turning ideas into working code
3. **Automating Repetitive Tasks** - CRUD functionality, test code generation
4. **Understanding and Modifying Large Codebases** - Reading existing code and making appropriate changes

### Success Factors

1. **Clear Instructions** - Be specific about what you want to build
2. **Incremental Progress** - Don't request everything at once, verify step by step
3. **Review Habit** - Always review generated code

## Relevance to the Workshop

These case studies demonstrate that even without programming experience, you can build practical things with Claude Code.

In the workshop, the goal is to build something "working" in one day. Based on these examples:

- TODO apps: **5-30 minutes**
- Business tools: **A few hours to 1 day**
- Full products: **A few days to 1 week**

are realistic timeframes.
