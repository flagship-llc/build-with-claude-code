## When to Ask a Mentor

Don't hesitate to call a mentor in these situations:

- Claude keeps repeating the same error
- You don't know what to ask
- You're unsure about direction
- You're anxious about whether your current approach is right
- Environment setup or tool issues won't resolve

**Time spent struggling alone is wasted time!**
Raise your hand and call a mentor.

### How to Ask for Help

```
"I asked Claude to do this, but I keep getting an error and it won't fix it"
"I know what I want to build, but where should I start?"
"Am I going about this the right way?"
```

Sharing your specific situation helps mentors give you advice quickly.

## Guidelines for Mentors

If you're participating as a mentor, please keep the following in mind.

### Core Principles

- **Don't do your own work** -- During the camp, focus entirely on supporting participants
- **Participant success is your success** -- Do everything you can to help each participant build something that works
- **Don't over-teach** -- Give hints that help participants think for themselves, rather than handing them answers
- **Help with Claude, not with code** -- Rather than writing code yourself, advise participants on what to tell Claude

### Support Guide

| Situation | Mentor Response |
|-----------|----------------|
| Stuck on an error | Teach how to read error messages, guide them on how to ask Claude |
| Can't decide what to build | Listen to their work/interests, help organize ideas together |
| Unsure about direction | Acknowledge what's going well, then present options |
| Trying to do too much | Suggest focusing on minimum features and getting something working first |
| Hands have stopped | Check in, understand the situation, and think through the next step together |

### Tips for Making the Rounds

- Walk around the venue regularly and approach anyone who seems stuck
- People staring at their screen without typing are likely having trouble
- A simple "How's it going?" lowers the barrier to asking for help
- If multiple people hit the same issue, announce the solution to everyone

### What Not to Do

- Take over a participant's laptop and write code directly (let them do it)
- Push your own preferred tech stack
- Dismiss a participant's approach with "this way is better"
- Work on your own personal development tasks
