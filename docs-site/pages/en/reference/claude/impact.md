# How Claude is Changing the World

AI, especially large language models like Claude, is fundamentally changing how software development works.

## "SaaS is Dead"

Since late 2025, the phrase "SaaS is Dead" has been spreading.

### The Shock to SaaS Companies

Following Anthropic's agent AI tool announcement, SaaS companies reportedly lost approximately $300 billion in market value on February 3, 2025 alone. Traditional SaaS companies relied on "seat-based pricing," but as AI agents begin operating directly via APIs without going through UIs, this revenue structure may collapse.

On the other hand, AI is analyzed as having "real, tangible utility." The implementation speed of generative AI is dramatically faster compared to historical infrastructure revolutions (like railroad networks), making it easier for expectations to be realized.

Claude Code's innovation lies in AI operating at the "OS layer" rather than just the application layer, giving it a structural advantage in replacing the user's actual work on their PC.

### The Traditional SaaS Model

Previously, when you wanted software, your options were limited:

1. **Buy off-the-shelf**: Compromise even if it doesn't 100% fit your needs
2. **Commission custom development**: High costs and long development time
3. **Build it yourself**: Programming skills required

### The AI Paradigm Shift

Tools like Claude Code have made the third option realistic:

- **Without programming experience**, you can create custom tools using natural language
- **Instead of subscribing to generic SaaS**, you can have tools that perfectly fit your workflow
- **Instead of hiring developers**, you can quickly experiment yourself

### Cowork and "Built with Claude" Tools

Starting with Anthropic's "Cowork" (an evolution of Claude Artifacts), the trend of building custom tools with AI is accelerating.

**Examples**:
- Auto-formatting meeting minutes in your company's format
- Calculation tools specific to your work
- Team-specific dashboards

These used to require finding a SaaS or commissioning development, but now "have Claude build it" is an option.

## The Era of AI Pair Programming

### From "Writing" to "Conversing"

Traditional programming:
```
Idea → Design → Write code → Test → Debug
```

AI pair programming:
```
Idea → Explain to Claude → Implement together → Feedback → Improve
```

**The skill of "writing code" is becoming less important than the skill of "explaining what you want to build."**

### Anyone Can Be a Builder

- **Designers** implementing their own prototypes
- **Marketers** creating their own analytics tools
- **Sales** customizing customer management tools
- **Researchers** building data processing pipelines

You no longer need to be a professional engineer to turn ideas into reality.
