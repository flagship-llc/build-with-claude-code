# How Claude is Changing the World

AI, especially large language models like Claude, is fundamentally changing how software development works.

## "SaaS is Dead"

Since late 2025, the phrase "SaaS is Dead" has been spreading.

### The Traditional SaaS Model

Previously, when you wanted software, your options were limited:

1. **Buy off-the-shelf**: Compromise even if it doesn't 100% fit your needs
2. **Commission custom development**: High costs and long development time
3. **Build it yourself**: Programming skills required

### The AI Paradigm Shift

Tools like Claude Code have made the third option realistic:

- **Without programming experience**, you can create custom tools using natural language
- **Instead of subscribing to generic SaaS**, you can have tools that perfectly fit your workflow
- **Instead of hiring developers**, you can quickly experiment yourself

### Cowork and "Built with Claude" Tools

Starting with Anthropic's "Cowork" (an evolution of Claude Artifacts), the trend of building custom tools with AI is accelerating.

**Examples**:
- Auto-formatting meeting minutes in your company's format
- Calculation tools specific to your work
- Team-specific dashboards

These used to require finding a SaaS or commissioning development, but now "have Claude build it" is an option.

## The Era of AI Pair Programming

### From "Writing" to "Conversing"

Traditional programming:
```
Idea → Design → Write code → Test → Debug
```

AI pair programming:
```
Idea → Explain to Claude → Implement together → Feedback → Improve
```

**The skill of "writing code" is becoming less important than the skill of "explaining what you want to build."**

### Anyone Can Be a Builder

- **Designers** implementing their own prototypes
- **Marketers** creating their own analytics tools
- **Sales** customizing customer management tools
- **Researchers** building data processing pipelines

You no longer need to be a professional engineer to turn ideas into reality.
